Telegram Bot (Prototype)
⚠️ This project is a prototype and is not structured as a production-ready application. It may lack proper modularization, error handling, and professional coding practices. Use it for experimentation or learning purposes.

Overview
This Telegram bot combines basic document handling, web search, and AI-generated responses to answer user queries. It's an early-stage prototype aimed at exploring the integration of multiple services within a single conversational bot.

Features
Document Uploading: Send documents to the bot for analysis (basic parsing implemented).

Web Search: Pulls limited real-time data from the web to assist in responses.

AI Responses: Uses AI APIs to generate answers to user questions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

A Telegram Bot Token

API keys for any third-party services used (search, AI)

1.Installation:
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tatikos/Telegram_bot.git
cd Telegram_bot
```
2.Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.Set environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory:
```bash
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_token
SEARCH_API_KEY=your_search_api_key
Documents=your_document_directory
```
4.Run the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

Limitations:

Prototype code; not structured for scalability or security.

No unit tests or input validation.

API keys and tokens are handled in a basic .env file setup.

Document parsing is simplistic.
